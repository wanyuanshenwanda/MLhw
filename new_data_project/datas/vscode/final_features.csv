268488,open,Add support for MCP servers over Unix domain sockets and named pipes,bwateratmsft,"Fixes #268487.

This PR adds support for doing StreamableHTTP MCP servers over Unix domain sockets and named pipes. For local MCP servers, this is generally more secure than standard localhost HTTP. Standard IO servers are still preferable for local MCP servers, but some scenarios are better served by StreambleHTTP--for example, an MCP server can be hosted in the extension host process by an extension using this approach.

/cc @connor4312

Below is some sample extension code. In practice, a random pipe/socket name should be used, and permissions enforced as well, but this shows the gist.

```typescript
export function activate() {

    const isWindows = os.platform() === 'win32';
    const socketPath = isWindows ? '\\\\.\\pipe\\hello-world' : path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'hello-world.sock');

    const socketUri = vscode.Uri.from({
        scheme: isWindows ? 'pipe' : 'unix',
        path: socketPath,
        fragment: '/mcp' // The express app below is configured to serve MCP over the `/mcp` route
    });

    vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider('hello-world', {
        provideMcpServerDefinitions(token: vscode.CancellationToken): vscode.McpServerDefinition[] {
            return [
                new vscode.McpHttpServerDefinition(
                    'hello-world',
                    socketUri,
                ),
            ];
        },
        resolveMcpServerDefinition(server: vscode.McpServerDefinition, token: vscode.CancellationToken): vscode.McpServerDefinition {
            startMcpServer(socketPath); // Additionally, the server should also be closed on extension deactivation
            return server;
        }
    });

}

function startMcpServer(socketPath: string) {
    // Uses express, same as the MCP TypeScript SDK examples
    const app = express();

    // MCP StreamableHTTP server setup, refer to examples at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk#streamable-http
    // ...

    // Listen on the socket/named pipe
    app.listen(socketPath);
}
```

268401,open,RFC: Chat Agent Queued Messages – Service-Based Queuing Architecture,digitarald,"# Chat Agent Queued Messages – Implementation Plan

## Summary
Enable queued user messages in the chat experience using a service-based architecture. While a chat request is in progress, additional submissions are queued (not lost), surfaced via a status bar indicator, and automatically dispatched as a single numbered Markdown list when the current request completes. Attachments from only the most recent queued message are retained. Execution context (mode, model, tools) is taken at flush time. Implementation follows existing VS Code patterns (services, disposables, observables, status bar contributions) and ships incrementally.

## Goals
- Let users continue writing during long-running executions without losing input.
- Minimal, unobtrusive visibility of pending prompts (status bar first; optional widget later).
- Automatic, reliable flush with correct context (mode/model/tools) at time of send.
- Preserve accessibility, telemetry, attachment semantics.
- Adhere to VS Code architectural & layering conventions for maintainability.

## Non-Goals
- Terminal / inline chat queuing (initially).
- Editing / reordering / deletion of individual queued items.
- Provider API or chat service contract changes.
- Unlimited queue size or large binary attachment aggregation in v1.

## Key Decisions
1. Service-based: `IChatQueueService` for cross-cutting queue state.
2. Universal queuing (any mode) to avoid mode-conditional logic.
3. Aggregation: single numbered Markdown list (1., 2., ...).
4. Attachment policy: only latest message's attachments applied at flush.
5. Context capture: evaluate mode/model/tools at flush, not per message.
6. Limits: max 5 messages, 10 KB each, 50 KB total per session.

## User Experience Flow
1. User submits while request in progress → input clears → status bar shows `$(clock) n`.
2. Tooltip: localized summary; optional command to inspect (future).
3. When request finishes (or is canceled), queue auto-flushes; status clears.
4. Screen reader announcements for ""message queued"" and ""queued messages sent"".

## Architecture Overview
- Files:
  - Interface: `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/common/chatQueueService.ts`
  - Impl: `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/common/chatQueueServiceImpl.ts`
  - Registration: `chat.contribution.ts` (singleton, delayed instantiation)
  - Status Bar: `chatQueueStatus.ts`
  - Widget integration (optional phase 2): `chatContentParts/ChatQueuedMessagesWidget` (not in v1)
- Core methods: `queueMessage(sessionId, text, attachments)`, `flushQueue(sessionId)`, `clearQueue(sessionId)`, `getQueueLength(sessionId)`
- Event: `onDidChangeQueue` emits `{ sessionId, length }` with debounce for UI efficiency.

## ChatWidget Integration (v1)
- Constructor: inject `@IChatQueueService`.
- Subscribe to `onDidChangeQueue` → update tooltip / context.
- Subscribe to `chatService.requestInProgressObs` → trigger flush when false.
- `_acceptInput`: if request in progress → queue (text + attachments), clear editor, fire existing accept event, do not send.
- Helpers: `maybeFlushQueue(sessionId)`, `updateSubmitButtonTooltip(count)`.

## Flush Logic
- Trigger: first transition of global `requestInProgress` to false with non-empty queue.
- Combine queued texts -> numbered Markdown list (blank line between items, trim whitespace).
- Use only latest message attachments.
- Clear queue pre-send to avoid duplication; on failure optionally restore or notify.

## Memory & Lifecycle
- Enforce per-message and total-text limits; truncate with ellipsis.
- Remove oldest messages when exceeding limits.
- Clear queues on session disposal (`chatService.onDidDisposeSession`).
- Detach all attachment references on clear for GC friendliness.

## Accessibility
- Announce queued additions (single vs multiple).
- Announce flush completion with message count.
- Status bar entry has ARIA label reflecting current count.

## Telemetry (Tentative)
Event: `chat.queueFlush`
- `messageCount`, `totalCharacters`, `hadAttachments` (boolean)
- Classification: System metadata (performance & feature usage).

## Status Bar (Phase 1 UI)
- Entry: `$(clock) <count>` right-aligned.
- Tooltip: localized summary; if feasible, preview first N chars of first & last item.
- Disposal when count=0.

## Optional Phase 2: Sticky Widget
- Only if status bar visibility insufficient per feedback.
- Pattern reuse: `ChatTodoListWidget` height calculation + layout hooks.

## Error & Edge Handling
- Flush failure: show notification with Retry; keep queue (or rehydrate) based on severity.
- Race protection: per-session in-flight flush promise map.
- Session switch with queued messages: auto-flush or warn & discard (decision left for validation; initial approach = auto-flush to reduce surprise).
- Agent mode unavailability mid-queue: still flush as generic chat input (no agent-only assumption).

## Testing Strategy
Unit (`chatQueueService.test.ts`): queue limits, truncation, event emission, flush ordering.
Integration (`chatWidget.integrationTest.ts`): queuing during active request, flush on completion, attachments from latest only.
Performance (`chatQueueService.perf.test.ts`): rapid enqueue (100 ops), time < target threshold, memory bounds.
Accessibility: ARIA label & announcement hooks (where test infra permits); manual verification fallback.
Failure scenarios: simulated send failure → retry path.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Memory growth via long texts | Strict per-message & total limits, truncation |
| User confusion (hidden queue) | Status bar indicator + tooltip + announcements |
| Race (double flush) | Single in-flight flush promise guard |
| Mode / session churn | Flush or clear on session disposal; universal queuing logic |
| Attachment mismatch | Only latest retained; log if earlier had attachments dropped |
| Performance regression | Debounce events; small fixed queue; perf test gate |
| Localization omissions | All new strings through `nls`, placeholder usage |

## File Structure (Planned Additions / Mods)
```
src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/
  common/
    chatQueueService.ts
    chatQueueServiceImpl.ts
  browser/
    chatQueueStatus.ts
    chatWidget.ts (modified)
    chat.contribution.ts (registration + status instantiation)
  test/
    common/chatQueueService.test.ts
    common/chatQueueService.perf.test.ts
    browser/chatWidget.integrationTest.ts
```

## Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Service + status bar + basic flush + tests.
Phase 2: Telemetry + accessibility refinements + error UX.
Phase 3: Optional sticky widget (only if justified).
Phase 4: Enhancements (preview command, cancellation, metrics adjustments).

## Architectural Decision Records
- ADR-1: Service vs local state → Service chosen for reuse & testability.
- ADR-2: Universal queuing (simpler, consistent UX) vs mode-limited.
- ADR-3: Status bar first (minimal footprint) before introducing new layout surface.
- ADR-4: Hard limits protect perf & memory at small complexity cost.

## Success Criteria
- Queue preserves user input reliably; zero data loss in tested cases.
- No regressions in existing chat flows (baseline run). 
- Flush latency negligible relative to standard request cycle.
- Accessibility announcements verified; localized strings added.
- Users can discover queued state without intrusive UI.

## Out of Scope (Future Consideration)
- Per-item editing / deletion controls.
- Per-item attachment merging.
- Cross-session queue transfer.
- Persistence of queue across reload.

268093,open,Feature/107183 add ability to right align tree items description,trapgar,"Issue #107183: Add a new right-aligned ""description"" property to TreeItems

Added the ability for VS Code extensions utilizing the [`TreeView`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/tree-view) to horizontally align the `description` property of `TreeItems` to the right. Default value remains left-aligned.

## How to Test
1. Clone the [vscode-extension-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) project
2. Open the [`tree-view-sample`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/tree-view-sample) in Code
3. Open [`src/nodeDependencies.ts#`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/main/tree-view-sample/src/nodeDependencies.ts#L98)
4. Add a new line right below where the `TreeItem.description` is being set
    > this.alignment = 'right';`

    *(since the repo references a released version of the vscode api you will want to also add an `// @ts-ignore` right about it just for testing)*
5. Run the extension as usual
6. Open any repo utilizing npm (I just created a new folder and ran `> npm i three`
7. Click on the new list clover in the left-hand sidebar that the extension added
8. Expand the tree and all the package versions will now be aligned to the right

Since `TreeItem` actions appear to the right, the description will hide any-time they show as to not clash.",2025-09-24 04:23:45+00:00,2025-09-26T09:09:34Z,,False,1,1,10,55,2,7,2,,64,1352,False,False,True,False,False,False,7,2,1286,11546,8417,3129,2,10,2.0,2.0,2025-09-24T04:31:09Z,vscode

Experiment for https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/268063
Demo extension implementation: https://github.com/joshspicer/joshbot/

GHPR: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/pull/7849
Claude: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/pull/1147

- Do not dynamically register chat participant (let extension do that)
- Introduce concept of 'untitled' chat session
  - First request is not lost (leans more on existing chat participant API)
- `onDidCommitChatSessionItem` to swap untitled sessions -> backed sessions

268039,open,fix(snap): detect Wayland socket under XDG_RUNTIME_DIR for Fedora,2410030357,"The proposed change fixes a Wayland detection issue in the VS Code snap launcher on Fedora and similar distributions. Currently, the script only checks for the Wayland socket in the parent runtime directory ($XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/../$WAYLAND_DISPLAY), which causes Wayland to be incorrectly marked unavailable when the socket is actually in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY. This patch updates the script to check both locations and enable Wayland if either exists, creating a symlink only when needed. The change ensures correct Wayland detection, maintains backward compatibility, avoids breaking existing setups, and allows VS Code and other applications to properly use Wayland instead of falling back to X11, with minimal and safe modifications to the launcher script.

Previous attempt https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/267856 was [reverted](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/268002) because first chat request in an empty window was not being rendered. This was because the chat list visibility was controlled by the welcomeView rendering logic. When the welcome view rendering was scheduled from within in `onDidChangeItems`, the chat list view visibility was not updated before the chat tree was progressively rendered which caused the first request to be missed.

In this pr, additional to the logic in #267856, I also moved out the logic to toggle visibility of the welcome/chatList view out of the welcome rendering logic here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/268023/files#diff-1a26fc97bbf0d39b6d25ad9fe509fad4d90373118985b50709f99b6ef5bde8c9R935

267991,open,Copy selection for deleted chunk in inline diff,Mingpan,"An attempt to fix #8226 

Hi @hediet , can I interest you with (yet another) PR for #8226, a.k.a. inline diff deleted chunk copy selection? :)

The main idea is to calculate the exact line and column for the start & end of the selection in a view zone, and extract the corresponding code chunk using the text model API.

Demo: 
![copySelectionInlineDelete](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b64cec2-aed4-4e39-9b5f-854cf3f06c83)

This works with both the menu item, and the browser 'copy' event (Ctrl/Cmd+C).

I have put the setup in a reusable method in a separate file, following the example of [renderLines.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/editor/browser/widget/diffEditor/components/diffEditorViewZones/renderLines.ts)

Due to the view zone, there are some hackery involved to get those line and column numbers right (the line number extraction is the same as that from the [inlineDiffDeletedCodeMargin.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/editor/browser/widget/diffEditor/components/diffEditorViewZones/inlineDiffDeletedCodeMargin.ts)). Let me know if you see any issues, or if you prefer to solve it in a different way.

Thanks!

An issue with this still is when I use VoiceOver's quick nav (enable with `UpArrow` and `DownArrow` simultaneously), then `H` or `Shift H` to go between headers is that the chat list does not scroll to reveal new headers. 

I have commented on https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/267152 to ask why header navigation is preferrable to our `upArrow/downArrow` list navigation mechanism that does scroll properly.

267785,closed,reduce memory by ~1.2 MB,SimonSiefke,"### Overview 

This changes the `toDisposable` function to use a class so that there is one dispose function on the class prototype instead of a dispose closure created for each `toDisposable` function call.

The memory savings seem to be ~1.2 MB.

### Function overview chart

This function overview chart of vscode shows how many function instances exist of each function: 

![base](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60588385-ad2c-4f9f-be21-f9024e3100cc)


Notably at the top is `createSingleCallFunction`, which is used by `toDisposable`.

267724,closed,Fix: Disable window shadows on macOS Tahoe to prevent GPU performance issues,avarayr,"## Summary

Fixes #267022
Fixes #267065

related: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/48311

macOS Darwin 26 (Tahoe) has a WindowServer bug that causes (some?) windows with shadows to consume 80%+ GPU resources. This change disables VSCode window shadows specifically for Darwin 25.x to work around the performance regression.

## Changes

- Added version check in `defaultBrowserWindowOptions` to detect Darwin 25.x
- Set `options.hasShadow = false` only on affected macOS versions
- Applied fix centrally to ensure all VSCode windows are affected consistently

## Testing

- Tested on macOS Tahoe - GPU usage drops significantly - from constant 80% to normal 15%

## Notes

This is a temporary workaround until Apple fixes the underlying WindowServer bug in macOS Tahoe. The version check can be refined or removed once the OS-level issue is resolved.",2025-09-22 00:49:21+00:00,2025-09-24T17:27:16Z,2025-09-24T17:27:16Z,True,6,3,3,14,1,2,9,2025-09-24 17:27:16+00:00,76,861,False,True,False,False,False,False,2,7,2969,29,21,8,2,3,7.0,7.0,2025-09-22T01:16:20Z,vscode

## Prerequisites
This PR improves recently introduced git worktree support.
1. Worktree detection improvements.
Worktree hierarchy in the `repository` tab of the SCM view is shown only when the **primary worktree** is open  as described in #259083 and upstream issues.
2. `${activeRepositoryName}` `window.title` variable
Currently, it simply shows the folder name of the _open worktree_.
By showing the `primary` worktree folder name instead, we'll support other variations to customize window.title.
If someone wants to stick to open worktree folder name, they can simply use `${folderName}` variable.
The detailed use-case is described in #251596.

The reason I combined these changes in a single PR is that primary repository name derivation is tightly coupled with the way SCM detects worktrees.

## Setup
```bash
mkdir test-folder && cd test-folder
git init repo && cd repo
touch test.txt && git add . && git commit -m ""init"" # introduce first commit
git worktree add test-worktree-inside
git worktree add ../test-worktree-outside
```
### Scenario 1: Opening the primary worktree 
It shouldn't be any different. Hierarchy is shown within the SCM view + worktrees are detected.
### Scenario 2: Opening the `test-worktree-inside` worktree
Should have the same output as Scenario 1.
### Scenario 3: Opening the `test-worktree-outside`
Should have the same output as Scenario 1.

## Notes
I could decouple the changes and submit another PR if required.
Also, I don't see any unit tests for the SCM `model.ts`. Let me know if I should add test coverage.
Although this PR improves worktree detection, it still doesn't support hierarchy using worktrees with bare repositories as reported in #267606",2025-09-21 18:04:04+00:00,2025-09-24T09:59:36Z,,False,1,2,9,36,1,3,3,,108,2041,False,False,False,False,True,False,3,1,38,8297,6448,1849,2,9,1.0,1.0,2025-09-21T18:09:57Z,vscode
267680,open,Fix NODE_OPTIONS environment variable inheritance on Windows,Prhmma,"## Summary
Fixes NODE_OPTIONS environment variable inheritance in VS Code integrated terminal on Windows. Currently, NODE_OPTIONS settings like `--max-old-space-size` are ignored when running Node.js processes from VS Code's integrated terminal on Windows, while they work correctly in regular cmd/PowerShell terminals.

## Associated Issue
Fixes #231076

## Root Cause
The issue has two parts:
1. **Platform Inconsistency**: The NODE_OPTIONS restoration logic was limited to macOS only (`if (isMacintosh)` condition)
2. **Missing Windows Support**: The Windows launcher script (`code.cmd`) didn't preserve NODE_OPTIONS like the macOS launcher does

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Windows Launcher Script (`resources/win32/bin/code.cmd`)
- Added preservation of `NODE_OPTIONS` and `NODE_REPL_EXTERNAL_MODULE` environment variables
- Follows the same pattern as the macOS launcher script
- Variables are saved as `VSCODE_NODE_OPTIONS` and `VSCODE_NODE_REPL_EXTERNAL_MODULE` before being cleared

### 2. Extended Terminal Environment Restoration (`src/vs/workbench/contrib/terminal/common/terminalEnvironment.ts`)
- Removed macOS-only condition for NODE_OPTIONS restoration
- Made the restoration logic work on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing macOS behaviour

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Set NODE_OPTIONS environment variable:
   ```powershell
   # In PowerShell (as Administrator for system-wide)
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(""NODE_OPTIONS"", ""--max-old-space-size=16384"", ""User"")",2025-09-21 16:42:55+00:00,2025-09-24T08:56:14Z,,False,1,0,3,17,13,2,1,,60,1555,False,True,False,False,False,False,2,1,9032,8238,6409,1829,2,3,1.0,1.0,2025-09-21T19:06:12Z,vscode

267583,closed,test(base): add unit tests for Event.fromObservable and fromObservabl…,SaaiAravindhRaja,"This pull request adds a new test suite for the `Event.fromObservable` and `Event.fromObservableLight` methods, ensuring their correct behavior when converting observables to events. The tests cover initial value emission, subsequent updates, disposal behavior, batch updates, and handling of undefined initial values.

**New tests for observable-to-event conversion:**

* Added `eventObservable.test.ts` with tests verifying that `Event.fromObservable` emits the initial value, subsequent changes, and stops after disposal, and that `Event.fromObservableLight` signals only on changes without payload.
* Included tests to ensure batch updates are coalesced into a single notification and that undefined initial values are handled correctly.

Combobox is more appropriate since it follows the a11y pattern of having a popup and controls a list. Attempts to improve communication with the screen reader by providing a more appropriate aria role.

Fixes: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/267445

## Steps to Test:
1. Checkout the PR: git checkout <branch-name>

2. Rebuild and Run the Project: Follow the standard process for building the project and launching the IDE.

3. Enable a screen reader: Turn on a screen reader on your operating system (e.g., VoiceOver on macOS, NVDA on Windows, or ChromeVox on ChromeOS).

4. Open the Quick Input Dialog: Use the keyboard shortcut to open the ""Search Workspaces"" or ""Open File"" dialog (e.g., Cmd+Shift+P or Cmd+P).

5. Verify the ARIA Role: Focus the search input field and listen to the screen reader's announcement. It should now announce the input as a ""combobox"" or something similar, confirming that the ARIA role has been correctly updated.

6. Test Functionality: Ensure that the core functionality of the input still works as expected. Verify that you can still type to filter the list of suggestions, use the arrow keys to navigate the list, and press Enter to select an item.

@bhavyaus fyi, I saw a bug where 2 welcome editors were opened, both active in the editor group. I am not sure if this is a recent regression but `matches` cannot be depending on a property such as `selectedCategory` that only gets set later because then there is a chance that you can open multiple getting started inputs that later all select the same category and then are all considered equal. The editor group relies on a deterministic `matches` implementation that does not change later.

266719,open,Add notification positioning setting,cyenite,"## Summary

Adds a new `workbench.notifications.position` setting that allows users to position notification toasts in any bottom corner of the workbench (bottom-right, bottom-left). This stems from an issue I face constantly, where notifications on the bottom right would often overlap my copilot chat window.

## Changes

- **Configuration**: Added `workbench.notifications.position` setting with enum validation
- **Constants**: Added `NotificationPosition` enum and `NOTIFICATIONS_POSITION_SETTING` constant
- **Logic**: Enhanced `NotificationsToasts` and `NotificationsCenter` to apply position classes based on configuration
- **Styling**: Added CSS for both bottom corner positions with proper animations and width constraints
- **Accessibility**: Maintained existing behavior and animations, added smooth transitions for all positions

## Implementation Details

- Default behavior unchanged (bottom-right positioning)
- Proper flex alignment for left vs right positioned notifications
- Configuration changes applied immediately without restart

## Testing

1. Change `workbench.notifications.position` setting in user settings
2. Trigger notifications (info, warning, error)
3. Verify notifications appear in correct corner
4. Test all positions: `bottomRight`, `bottomLeft`
5. Verify animations work correctly for each position

This PR fixes an issue with scrolling in Copilot chats with many code blocks (100+). The behavior is that after scrolling up and down through the chat, some code blocks shrink to 0 height and the code is no longer visible. See the included video for an example:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98af5b0a-6951-4bc3-b2dd-0f68c9fad906

---

### Root Cause
The problem came from how `CodeBlockModelCollection` was disposing models. It was calling `ref.object.dispose()`, which disposes the **underlying text model itself**. Instead, it should call `ref.dispose()`, which disposes the **reference** and releases it.  

By disposing the model directly, later code block components ended up with null/invalid models during virtualization cycles. That’s why editors collapsed or reported `content height = -1`.

---

### Fix
Replace calls to `ref.object.dispose()` with `ref.dispose()` in `delete()` and `clear()`. This properly disposes the reference, allowing models to remain valid and be reused when scrolling back.

---

### Testing
- Manually tested with an OSS build of VS Code and Copilot Chat, reproducing the bug with >100 code blocks. After the fix, blocks remain visible when scrolling.  
- Ran automated tests (`./scripts/test.sh`) with no regressions.  
- See fix example here:  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4425097-919a-4212-8d63-4890af7a6c57

266123,closed,feat: add resource-scoped prompt file recommendations,digitarald,"This PR enhances the `chat.promptFilesRecommendations` setting to support workspace folder-level configuration with proper inheritance hierarchy.

## Changes

- **Configuration scope**: Added `ConfigurationScope.RESOURCE` to enable folder-level settings
- **Context-aware recommendations**: Prompt suggestions now consider the active editor's workspace folder
- **Configuration merging**: Implemented proper inheritance (default → user → workspace → folder)

## Key Benefits

- Different projects can have tailored prompt recommendations
- Workspace folder settings override workspace/user settings appropriately  
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing global configurations
- Enables resource-aware when clauses (e.g., `resourceExtname == .js`) to work correctly

## Implementation

Follows established VS Code patterns:
- Uses `EditorResourceAccessor.getOriginalUri()` for resource context (consistent with 20+ other features)
- Leverages `configService.inspect()` with resource parameter for proper configuration inheritance
- Maintains type safety and robust error handling

The changes make the existing documentation for resource-aware when clauses fully functional.",2025-09-11 01:29:36+00:00,2025-09-17T21:54:03Z,2025-09-17T21:54:01Z,True,0,6,3,41,34,3,6,2025-09-17 21:54:01+00:00,53,1183,False,False,True,True,False,False,3,0,0,3294,2313,981,1,3,,,,vscode

I really think that removing this is not going to affect any folks that much and so I want to try removing it. In doing so this fixes a couple of long standing issues.

This pull request addresses issue #265989 by updating the placement of the cancel button in the dialog component.
Previously, the cancel button was inserted at a fixed position using buttonMap.splice(1, 0, cancelButton);, which could lead to inconsistencies in button order, especially when dialogs have custom button configurations.

**Change summary**:

Replaces buttonMap.splice(1, 0, cancelButton); with buttonMap.push(cancelButton); in src/vs/base/browser/ui/dialog/dialog.ts
Ensures the cancel button is always placed at the end of the button list for consistent UI behavior
Impact:

Dialog cancel button will appear in a more predictable and user-friendly position
Aligns with standard dialog button placement practices

fix #265845

In https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/212163, the `registerSupportedExecutions` was changed so that in web mode, the function doesn't wait for all default task extensions registration before running the task, because in web mode, only the `custom` mode is supported.

However, when there is a remote server, the server will register the support for all task execution types, but later.

A race condition can happen, in which the tasks are parsed before the server reports the supported task executions, leading to a `Warning: shell tasks are unavailable in the current environment.` error.

This PR makes the `registerSupportedExecutions` method wait for all task supported executions in web mode when there is a remote agent.

This pull request fixes a bug in the email validation logic within the `McpElicitationService`. The previous implementation incorrectly marked emails containing an '@' as invalid; this change corrects the logic to properly validate email addresses.

- Bug fix: Corrected the email validation in the `_validateStringFormat` method of `McpElicitationService` to ensure that values containing an '@' are now considered valid emails.

It seems that when scrolling the the inlay hints are queried and added to `sessionDisposables` making `sessionDisposables` grow by one each time.


### Change

The change uses a separate `disposableStore` so that each time the `RunOnceScheduler` runs, the previous `disposableStore` removed and disposed. 


In order to not manage the `cancelToken`, `disposableStore` and `mutableDisposable` individually, a new class `CancellationStore` has been added that combines them.",2025-09-04 16:22:23+00:00,2025-09-09T16:05:57Z,,False,0,0,6,45,15,1,0,,30,645,False,True,False,False,False,False,1,0,0,51609,42253,9356,1,6,,,,vscode

![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73051090-cb01-4553-a368-3570fa4fe188)



When typing into the editor 197 times, it seems that the number of QuickDiffModel functions increases by one each time. 






<br>

The json lists `src/vs/workbench/contrib/scm/browser/quickDiffModel.ts:232:10` as source:


```ts
this._diffDelayer
	.trigger(async () => {
		const result: { allChanges: QuickDiffChange[]; changes: QuickDiffChange[]; mapChanges: Map<string, number[]> } | null = await this.diff();

		const editorModels = Array.from(this._originalEditorModels.values());
		if (!result || this._disposed || this._model.isDisposed() || editorModels.some(editorModel => editorModel.isDisposed())) {
			return; // disposed
		}

		this.setChanges(result.allChanges, result.changes, result.mapChanges);
	})
	.catch(err => onUnexpectedError(err)); // here

```

<br>

After registering the `_diffDelayer` disposable, the issue seems to be resolved.

This PR adds support for showing ""implementations"" CodeLens on TypeScript methods that are overridden in derived classes.

Changes
Extended TypeScriptImplementationsCodeLensProvider to surface implementations for:
Class methods (not just interfaces or abstract methods)
Overridden methods in derived classes
Updated extractSymbol logic to correctly identify these symbols
Added smoke test: implementationsCodeLens.test.ts to validate behavior
Why
Resolves https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/198387.

Developers can now see ""1 implementation"" / ""n implementations"" CodeLens above methods that are overridden, and navigate directly to their derived class implementations.
This aligns CodeLens behavior with the “Find All Implementations” command.

Verification
Open an abstract/base class with a method that is overridden in derived classes.
Confirm that the ""implementations"" CodeLens appears above the method.
Clicking it navigates to the derived class overrides.
Testing
Local build & compile successful
Hygiene checks passed
Smoke test added & executed
Integration tests run successfully (scripts/test-integration.bat)
Notes
This improvement makes CodeLens more consistent and increases productivity when working with object-oriented TypeScript codebases.

Fixes https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/198387",2025-09-02 12:56:49+00:00,2025-09-26T07:17:01Z,,False,12,9,1,84,14,4,21,,81,1330,False,True,False,False,True,False,4,14,1186,98,84,14,1,1,3.0,14.0,2025-09-02T12:57:24Z,vscode

## Problem
Dropdown menus in the settings editor were opening too far away from their trigger controls, causing visual disconnect and poor UX.

## Solution
Added a 10px offset specifically for dropdown positioning in the settings editor by detecting the `.settings-editor` class context.

## Changes
- Modified `getDomNodePagePosition()` in `src/vs/base/browser/dom.ts`
- Added settings page detection using `closest('.settings-editor')` 
- Applied 10px vertical offset only for settings editor dropdowns

## Testing
Verified dropdowns now open with proper proximity to controls in settings editor while maintaining normal behavior elsewhere.",2025-09-01 17:45:47+00:00,2025-09-06T17:05:35Z,,False,2,0,3,3,1,1,2,,80,657,False,True,False,False,False,False,1,2,264,5819,3679,2140,1,3,2.0,2.0,2025-09-02T18:55:25Z,vscode

⚠️ This PR updates PATH handling logic in the Windows installer.
Changes are verified with string-based tests (PowerShell), but I would appreciate further testing on real Windows setups.


## Summary
Normalize PATH handling in the Windows installer (`build/win32/code.iss`) and fix uninstall filtering:
- Trim trailing separators when comparing (`\` and `/`)
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Consider 8.3 short names (when available)
- Handle empty / semicolon-terminated PATH without producing malformed values

## Why
- Avoid duplicate PATH entries when the existing entry has a trailing slash or is in 8.3 short form.
- Ensure uninstall removes VS Code’s PATH entry (both long and short forms).

## How
- Add `TrimTrailingSlash` helper.
- `NeedsAddToPath`: explode PATH, normalize each segment, compare against long and short names.
- `AddToPath`: treat empty/absent PATH specially; respect trailing `;`.
- Uninstall: normalize `{app}\bin`, compare against both long/short, rebuild PATH cleanly.

## Before / After (examples)
- **Before**: PATH contains `…;C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\bin\` → installer adds `…;C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\bin` (duplicate).
- **After**: no duplicate added.
- **Before**: PATH contains `…;C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~1\bin` → uninstall sometimes leaves it behind.
- **After**: long/short both removed.

## Verification
- Windows Sandbox, PowerShell dry-run (strings only; no system writes):
  - trailing slash present → `NeedsAddToPath: False`; `RemoveFromPath`: entry removed
  - 8.3 short present → `NeedsAddToPath: False`; `RemoveFromPath`: entry removed
  - empty PATH → `AddToPath`: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\bin`
  - PATH ends with `;` → no malformed value produced
(Full installer tests can be run if preferred.)

## Risk / Impact
Low: changes are isolated to installer script and guarded when 8.3 names are not available.

264133,closed,Git: Remove problematic ruler at 50 chars,walles,"The ruler at column 50, introduced in #201091, is wrong for all lines except for the first. Also, having it there breaks interaction with the (quite popular) rewrap extension:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap

The best solution would be if we could have different rulers for different lines, (50 for line 1, 0 for line 2 and 72 for the rest), but since that's not possible (or is it?), I believe dropping 50 is the best way forward.

Regarding the user experience, overflowing chars are highlighted anyway since #173195, so users who write too long subject lines will still be informed, even without that ruler in place.

Since I use rewrap all the time, and I commit things all the time, the current behavior is problematic for me.

""rewrap"" uses the rulers to decide where to wrap text.

Before #201091, it wrapped at 72 chars, which was great!

With #201091 in place, it now wraps all lines at 50 chars, which is bad.

* `completion` promise was being changed to `Canceled` despite it already being resolved.

See my [verbose(!) debugging comment](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/264023#issuecomment-3237889813)
which walks you through states of `ConfirmationKind`
in `getIcon` under different commits.

Fixes #264023.
Relates #263314 (`getIcon` added by @connor4312).
Relates #262982 (`ConfirmationKind.UserSetting` added by @Tyriar).
Supercedes #264047 (revert of a commit that changed confirmation logic from sync -> async by @rwoll).

Reviewers: I'm not 100% on what the expected UI iconography experience is, so
please verify that the icons align with what y'all have in mind.

Suggested follow ups:

- Tests - especially one around `getIcon` to ensure it handles `ConfirmationKind`
      exhaustively as folks add new kinds.

263913,closed,Add URL handler for chat message,ntrogh,"This URL handler allows external applications to insert messages into the VS Code chat interface via URLs. The chat message is inserted in the chat input field but is _not_ submitted. The user is prompted if they want to insert the specific prompt in chat.

## URL Format

```
code-oss:chat-message?prompt=<encoded-prompt-text>&mode=<chat-mode>
```

### Parameters

- `prompt` (required): The text to insert into the chat input field (URL encoded)
- `mode` (optional): The chat mode to set. Defaults to 'agent'. Supports both built-in modes ('ask', 'edit', 'agent') and custom chat modes defined in `.chatmode` files

## Examples

```
code-oss:chat-message?prompt=Hello%20World
```

```
code-oss:chat-message?prompt=Explain%20this%20code&mode=ask
```

```
code-oss:chat-message?prompt=Review%20my%20JavaScript%20code%20for%20potential%20bugs%20and%20security%20issues&mode=agent
```

## Test steps

1. Run **Developer: Open URL** command in Command Palette
1. Enter a URL like:
   - `code-oss:chat-message?prompt=Test%20prompt`
   - `code-oss:chat-message?prompt=Hello&mode=ask`

The handler should:
1. Show a confirmation dialog with the prompt preview

263781,closed,Maintain line breaks in transform to Camel and Pascal case actions,alpalla,"Fixes https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/261387.

# Transform to Camel Case

## Single line transformations

I split this in two cases. When a single line (without line breaks) is selected, the behavior remains unchanged. I did this because I noticed unit tests that assert that white space characters should be considered as valid word boundaries.

Example
```
""camel from words"" -> ""camelFromWords""
``` 

## Multiline transformations

On the other hand, in case of a selection spanning multiple lines I changed the relevant regex to only consider `_` and `-` as valid word boundaries. Effectively guaranteeing correct transformations only when coming from kebab or snake case. 

I did this because considering tabs as word boundaries will break the indentation for a code block. And as @RedCMD suggested, I also think it makes sense to treat `a-b c-d` as separate words (-> `aB cD`).

# Transform to Pascal Case

Here I was much more conservative because this transformation has some extra logic to capitalize the first letter of a word
```ts
return words.map((word: string) => word.substring(0, 1).toLocaleUpperCase() + word.substring(1))
			.join('')
```
Therefore not using spaces and tabs as word boundaries would execute the above logic on spaces and tabs. It was easier to just address the line break problem here and not get lost in edge cases.

# Testing
I added some unit tests, and this should be straightforward to test manually 🙌🏻

263749,closed,"feat(ts-codeLens): show ""implementations"" CodeLens for overridden methods",ritesh006,"### Summary
This PR adds support for showing **""implementations"" CodeLens** on TypeScript methods that are overridden in derived classes.

### Changes
- Extended `TypeScriptImplementationsCodeLensProvider` to surface implementations for:
  - Class methods (not just interfaces or abstract methods)
  - Overridden methods in derived classes
- Updated `extractSymbol` logic to correctly identify these symbols
- Added smoke test: `implementationsCodeLens.test.ts` to validate behavior

### Why
Resolves [#198387](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/198387).

Developers can now see `""1 implementation""` / `""n implementations""` CodeLens above methods that are overridden, and navigate directly to their derived class implementations.  
This aligns CodeLens behavior with the **“Find All Implementations”** command.

### Verification
- Open an abstract/base class with a method that is overridden in derived classes.
- Confirm that the `""implementations""` CodeLens appears above the method.
- Clicking it navigates to the derived class overrides.

### Testing
- **Local build & compile successful**
- **Hygiene checks passed**
- **Smoke test added & executed**
- **Integration tests run successfully** (`scripts/test-integration.bat`)

### Notes
This improvement makes CodeLens more consistent and increases productivity when working with object-oriented TypeScript codebases.

Also contains some structural improvements that organize things a bit and prevent button(s) from getting into broken states. No longer any reliance on context keys or entitlements, just the gh token, and `privateUri` which makes this somewhat extensible

This PR introduces a new `promptFilesRecommendations` configuration setting that allows users to configure which prompt files should be suggested in the chat welcome view based on contextual when-clause expressions or simple boolean values.

<img width=""1102"" height=""681"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10b090bf-ae5b-4fec-a772-d8536276c01a"" />

cc @eli-w-king 

## Key Features

- **Contextual suggestions**: Configure prompt files to appear based on file type, language, or other VS Code context
- **Flexible configuration**: Support both boolean values (`true`/`false`) and when-clause expressions
- **Smart caching**: Async loading of prompt descriptions to avoid blocking UI rendering
- **Unified experience**: Suggestions now work in both experimental and regular welcome views

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  ""promptFilesRecommendations"": {
    ""plan"": true,                            // Always suggest
    ""a11y-audit"": ""resourceExtname == .html"", // Only for HTML files  
    ""document"": ""resourceLangId == markdown"", // Only for Markdown files
    ""debug"": false                           // Never suggest
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Configuration Schema
- Added proper JSON schema with `oneOf` constraints supporting mixed boolean/string types
- Comprehensive validation and error handling for when-clause parsing
- Experimental tag with clear documentation and examples

### UI Integration
- Enhanced `ChatWidget` with intelligent prompt suggestion logic
- Added description caching to avoid async calls during rendering
- Graceful fallback when descriptions fail to load

### Welcome View Improvements
- Moved suggested prompts rendering outside experimental-only blocks
- Updated re-render logic to account for prompt suggestion changes
- Added helpful onboarding message when no agent-specific welcome exists

## Testing

- ✅ Configuration parsing handles various input types correctly
- ✅ When-clause evaluation integrates properly with VS Code context system
- ✅ Error handling gracefully degrades on invalid configurations
- ✅ UI updates correctly when suggestions change

## Related Issues

Enhances the reusable prompts feature by making suggestions context-aware and user-configurable.

# Fix #-mentions search for files and folder backspace bug

## Reproduction Steps
- have a folder called test with a file called index.md
- user types #t and ""test"" shows up as a result
- user blackspaces
- user types #t again

expected:
- ""test"" folder should show

actual:
- nothing shows

---

Additionally, you can see a large variance in search results with you type a part of a filename (e.g ""hel"" attempting to match a file called ""hello.js""). When you first start typing, the results show quite well. Once to backspace, immediately all relevant values drop off.

263210,open,Preserve case in multicursor replace command,alpalla,"# Problem
Fixes https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/106502.

Reading through the issue it seems the main problem involves preserving the case of the first letter of a variable name when executing a replace command on multiple case-insensitive selections of that word.

# Solution
To fix this, when defining the replace command for a given selection, we can check the case of the first letter of the text to replace, and update the case of the character that will replace it accordingly.

So if we have selections `""value""` and `""Value""`, and type `""a""` (while typing `array`), when composing the replace command for `""Value""` we see that it starts with a capital and replace the selection with `""A""`, not with `""a""`.

For now this logic is only applied in the case of multiple selections.

# Testing
Given
```
const [value, setValue] = useState();
```

Select `""value""` and `""Value""`, and then type `""array""`.

Expected result
```
const [array, setArray] = useState();
```

This pulls in a lot of specs from upstream. Some of the bigger ones are gh, docker/docker-compose and ruff. This is mostly really safe but there are some parts of this that results in command execution. I reviewed all the specs for troublesome scripts/generators, removing any that look concerning.

To make this more sustainable in the long run it would be so much better if the generators that can execute code were separated from the plain text completions. There aren't that many generators but they are higher risk.

263146,open,Issue #210694 add hoverforeground and hoverbackground to activity bars,AminSajedian,"This pull request introduces customizable hover colors for the side, top, and bottom activity bars.

The changes address issue #210694 (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/210694), which requested the ability to set hoverForeground and hoverBackground for a more visible hover state on activity bar icons. This implementation allows users to define specific colors in their settings to improve the discoverability and accessibility of the UI.

I've added the necessary color token properties to the activity bar's color contribution points to enable this feature. @benibenj (https://github.com/benibenj)

Testing:
I have verified that the new color settings work as expected and do not introduce any regressions. The hover state now correctly reflects the colors specified in the user's settings.


Modified Files Summary

1. Theme Color Definition [src/vs/workbench/common/theme.ts]
- Define new theme color tokens:
  - `ACTIVITY_BAR_HOVER_FOREGROUND`
  - `ACTIVITY_BAR_HOVER_BACKGROUND`
  - `ACTIVITY_BAR_TOP_HOVER_FOREGROUND`
  - `ACTIVITY_BAR_TOP_HOVER_BACKGROUND`

2. Activity Bar: Theming + Wiring [src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/activitybar/activitybarPart.ts]
- Register new hover tokens in theme registry
- Map hover tokens to CSS variables for stylesheet consumption
- Wire hover colors into composite bar configuration

3. Activity Bar CSS (Hover Styles) [src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/activitybar/media/activityaction.css]
- Apply hover styles using new CSS variables:
  - `--vscode-activityBar-hoverForeground`
  - `--vscode-activityBar-hoverBackground`
- Integrate hover states with existing active/focus styling

4. Sidebar: Theming Integration [src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/sidebar/sidebarPart.ts]
- Reference top-position hover tokens for consistency:
  - `ACTIVITY_BAR_TOP_HOVER_FOREGROUND`
  - `ACTIVITY_BAR_TOP_HOVER_BACKGROUND`
- Ensure sidebar hover behavior aligns with activity bar when positioned at top or bottom

5. Sidebar CSS (Hover Styles) [src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/sidebar/media/sidebarpart.css]
- Apply hover styling using activity bar CSS variables
- Maintain visual consistency between sidebar and activity bar hover states

6. Stylelint Allowlist [build/lib/stylelint/vscode-known-variables.json]
- Add CSS custom properties to prevent lint errors:
  - `--vscode-activityBar-hoverForeground`
  - `--vscode-activityBar-hoverBackground`

Usage
user's settings:

settings.json
```
{
  ""workbench.activityBar.location"": ""default"", // ""top"" or ""bottom""
  ""workbench.colorCustomizations"": {
    // Left Activity Bar 
    ""activityBar.hoverForeground"": ""#ff0000"",

![code-lens-count-before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69b9b3f9-335b-4f7f-99fa-50516ebc81c6)

In the code lens controller, the old code lens models don't seem to be cleared in all cases.  It seems they are only cleared if `toResolve.length` is greater than zero. Due to the early return, the cleanup seems missing for the case `toResolve.length === 0 `.



```ts
// before
private _resolveCodeLensesInViewport(): void {

    /* ... */
    if (toResolve.length === 0) {
	    return; 
    }

    /* ... */ 
    this._oldCodeLensModels.clear();
}
```

After: 
![code-lens-count-after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e55df01-5eca-4189-bd5e-732922656808)


 The change is to clear oldCodeLensModels in both cases:


```ts
// after
private _resolveCodeLensesInViewport(): void {

    /* ... */
    if (toResolve.length === 0) {
		this._oldCodeLensModels.clear();
	    return;

This is resolved by iterating over the current selection and calling remove on those items in the case where no item is provided.

262980,open,Explorer: add `explorer.collapseResource` to collapse a specific folder (by URI) without changing focus (#261598),Csabesz07,"## Summary
Adds two new commands `explorer.collapseResource` and `explorer.collapseResourceRecursive` that collapses a specific folder (and it's child folders with the recurscive command) in the Explorer given its resource URI, without changing focus/selection.

## Motivation
Extensions and automation need to collapse folders programmatically without UI flicker or stealing focus. Existing commands operate only on the focused element. This would allow the development of an extension which keeps the explorer tidy.

## Implementation
- Registers `explorer.collapseResource` (args: `URI`).
- Registers `explorer.collapseResourceRecursive` (args: `URI`).
- No behavior change to existing commands.

## Backwards compatibility
- New commands only; no changes to existing public commands.

When clicking the 10 right-most characters of the editor, the cursor was moved to the end of the line. This is not correct in RTL. Clicking the left pixels should move the cursor to the left. Clicking the right pixels should move the cursor to the right.

This was an oversight in #255455.

Also the `horizontalScrollPadding` is hardcoded to 10. I noticed in my own editor this means I can’t put the cursor between the first two characters in VSCode.

262959,open,fix(editor)(#261780): transform UPPER_CASE to PascalCase,Selva-Ganesh-M,"fixes #261780

The fix supports the new expectation:

> FOO_BAR → FooBar
> 
> FOO BAR A → FooBarA

while keeping the current behavior intact:

> parseHTMLString → ParseHTMLString,
> 
> audioConverter.convertM4AToMP3() → AudioConverter.ConvertM4AToMP3()

Added unit tests to cover both cases.

reviews and suggestions are welcome.

262910,open,Fix out of bounds text selection with line wrapping,remcohaszing,"The original behaviour is confusing and somewhat hard to explain. Given a Monaco editor with text wrapping enabled, if the user starts selecting text and moves the mouse outside of the editor viewbox, to the right of the screen, the cursor in the editor would be somewhere halfway the editor. The editor cursor did move with the mouse. So moving the mouse further right, moved the cursor further forward. The text cursor could even move onto the next line, below the mouse position. In case of RTL, the behaviour was the same. Further right means more forward, meaning it was visually mirrored.

The new behaviour with this PR is easier to explain. If the cursor moves out of bounds while selecting text, the selection will match the end of the wrapped line at column matching the cursor height. It also takes RTL into account.

The new behaviour matches gedit, LibreOffice, Google Docs, HTML content in browsers, and even Monaco Editor with text wrapping disabled.

262704,closed,chat: use language model metadata when restoring persisted default model (fixes included models fallback),parsasabetz,"Fixes [#262698](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/262698)

Summary:
Remove hard-coded `'copilot/gpt-4.1'` special-case when restoring the persisted selected model in the Copilot chat input. The code now looks up the persisted model metadata and uses `isDefault` to determine whether the persisted selection was the default at the time of storing.

Files changed:
- `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/chatInputPart.ts`

Problem:
Stable builds were restoring only `copilot/gpt-4.1` as the fallback default model due to a literal string check (`persistedSelection === 'copilot/gpt-4.1'`). This prevented other included (0x) models from being restored/selected as fallback.

Change:
- Lookup the persisted model via `languageModelsService.lookupLanguageModel(...)`.
- When reading the `.isDefault` storage fallback, use the model's metadata: `persistedModel?.isDefault ?? false`.
- Preserve the existing restore logic but avoid the `copilot/gpt-4.1` hard-coded special-case.

Testing / notes:
- Local TypeScript compile check (`npm run tsec-compile-check`) completed with no errors in my environment.
- I did not run the full product compile locally (_heavy_). CI should run the full build/test matrix and catch any further issues.
- This change should be low-risk; it removes **a single** hard-coded special case and **uses existing model metadata**.

Follow-ups:
- If CI flags anything, I will iterate on the PR.
- Consider adding a small unit test for the persisted default logic if there's a unit-test surface available for `ChatInputPart` or the model restoration logic.

Cleaner change for the For-In Loop snippets. With an early continue for 1 less indent & does not trigger [ESLint no-prototype-builtins](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-prototype-builtins)

I used `Object.hasOwn(${2:object}, ${1:key})` over `${2:object}.hasOwn(${1:key})` because the latter only showed ""any"" in the hover poup while the former gives the method's  documentation from the `ObjectConstructor` typescript interface.

When opted in, we also switch over to using custom dialogs & the simple file picker so that the automation can control it.

This was added so that we can do auth flows, which uses dialogs. Now we will be able to complete an auth flow (with the help of the user in the browser) and automate interacting with chat via the development MCP server.

Some tools, like the Playwright test runner CLI, ellipsize filenames with the `…` character:

At the moment, the ellipsized path isn't clickable because VS Code's fuzzy matching doesn't handle that character well. This PR adds `…` as an alternative wildcard. This makes both the terminal path matching and the file quick picker find the file.

262370,closed,Wait for agent loop to finish in automation,rwoll,"Automation needs to determine when the ""chat loop"" has reached a terminal state so it can inspect the state of the workspace. To support this, `workbench.action.chat.open` now accepts an optional `blockOnResponse` flag (defaulting to non-blocking).

Additionally, when a terminal state is reached, automation must be able to determine the precise error that's hit. To support this, `IChatResponseErrorDetails.code` has been added. While `IChatResponseErrorDetails` has a number of flags (`isQuotaExceeded`, etc.) we do not want to formally introduce more arbitrary states to the API as flags. Instead, `code` can be used/set by a Chat Extension.

As a follow up, [`getErrorDetailsFromChatFetchError`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/32fd96c50a9044a811bf264cfa38d9e979eb99d2/src/platform/chat/common/commonTypes.ts#L263) in the Chat extension will be updated to set the new `code` field.

262233,open,feat: Add Swipe to Navigate for macOS touchpads.,seivan,"Edit: [Alternative implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/262262) registers the swipe recognizers and expose them as an extension API instead: 

Following options have been added:

- 	`""disabled""` – Disable swipe navigation.
- 	`""editor""` – Switch editor tabs across all groups (previous/next).
- 	`""editorInGroup""` – Switch editor tabs within the current group only (previous/next).
- 	`""history""` – Move through most recently used editors (MRU) across all groups (previous/next).
- 	`""historyInGroup""` – Move through most recently used editors (MRU) within the current group (previous/next).
- 	`""group""` – Change focus to neighboring editor groups (left/right/up/down).
- 	`""navigation""` – Move through navigational history (for example: Go To References).
- 	`""edit""` – Navigate cursor edit locations.
- 	`""navigationEdit""` – Navigate through a combined history of navigation and edit locations.

Alternatively, the setting can be defined as an object:

```json 
""workbench.editor.swipeToNavigate"": {
  ""horizontal"": ""navigationEdit"",
  ""vertical"": ""disabled""
}
```

Can also support custom actions: 
```json
""workbench.editor.swipeToNavigate"": {
  ""horizontal"": ""disabled"",
  ""vertical"": { ""previous"": ""commandId1"", ""next"": ""commandId2"" }
}
```

Requires these OS settings:

Older OS settings: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/895e540f-dc46-4d18-9f7a-7aa0516cebbc)


Also I think there is a misunderstanding in previous threads, swipes don't work unless you activate them on OS level (as per screenshot). There is a distinction between swiping and panning, the latter is fullscreen.  
It is very possible that you had [disabled](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/19131#issuecomment-613751165) them on your OS level and assumed they didn't work.

Previous discussions with @bpasero indicated there was no interest in adding more Electron APIs. However, Electron applications such as Discord have supported swipe gestures for years without issues, and Touch Bar integration is already supported and that uses Electron APIs. Swipe gestures have been stable in Electron for a long time and have not caused problems, outside of that misunderstanding

~~Another option would be to expose events for extensions, though I am not sure how to get started with that. I assume it would require approval before introducing a new extension API.~~

I previously attempted this through an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Seivan.swipe-to-navigate), but it relied on heavy hacks and monkey-patching the bootloader. These broke with every VS Code update and were difficult to maintain, since I had to inspect the generated JavaScript to figure out where to apply the patches. This approach is unsustainable.

I rely on swipe gestures for navigation as an accessibility feature. Swiping to move between views is a native macOS behavior supported in Xcode, Safari, Finder, Terminal, Notes, and more. The lack of support in VS Code feels inconsistent with the platform.

At the very least, the swipe gesture recognizers should be exposed via an extension like the alternative PR https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/262262 and let extensions (I've done one) define actions for them.

262032,open,Fix: clear duplicate-casing errors after case-only file renames on Windows (closes #261995),kzekiue,"On case-insensitive file systems (Windows for example) renaming a file by only changing its letter-case ~ for example `page1.js` => `Page1.js` ~ confuses `tsserver`.  
It continues to hold both casings in the program and surfaces errors such as:


<img width=""932"" height=""191"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb79ecbc-3934-44f0-a540-a2d4c425c308"" />


The error persists until the user manually restarts the TS server or reloads VS Code (see bug #261995).

### RCA
File-watcher stacks don’t always emit a delete => create sequence for a case-only rename on case-insensitive FSs.  
`tsserver` therefore never drops the old path and thinks the file is duplicated.

### Testing
* Verified on Windows 11.  

### Files changed
* `extensions/typescript-language-features/src/languageFeatures/updatePathsOnRename.ts`
* `extensions/typescript-language-features/src/typeScriptServiceClientHost.ts`

* Launch the `Launch MCP Server` task
* Start the server via the `mcp.json` in the workspace

This is a first stab at rendering token usage in Chat. Feedback is very much welcome. Open questinos:
1) Do we already have a utility that summs up all the tokens in the session (I could not find it, so I am manully implementing it in the renderer). I would love to simplify this.
2) I am not a fan of ""(preview)(0x)"" rendering - double brackets. Ideas on what better to do are welcome

Next steps are to colour this in some warning colour once we are above 85%. @roblourens I think that is the limit you use for summarization 

I was not convinced where to render the token usage, but after much delibaration I think showing it only on the last request actually works nicely. E.g. then it is more married to the session than to the actual request (hopefully).

Justin if you do not like the implementation let me know and I can start over - I tried to keep it minimal.

261815,closed,Fix OAuth2 resource parameter compliance with RFC 8707,bluedog13,"## Summary

This PR fixes VS Code's OAuth2 flow to comply with RFC 8707 by including the resource parameter in token exchange requests.

## Problem

The current implementation includes the resource indicator in the authorization request but omits it from both the authorization code and refresh token exchange requests. This violates RFC 8707 and can cause token validation failures on protected resources that require the resource parameter to be consistently present throughout the OAuth2 flow.

## Solution

Added the resource parameter to both token exchange methods in the `DynamicAuthProvider` class:
- `exchangeCodeForToken()` - now includes resource parameter when exchanging authorization code for tokens
- `exchangeRefreshTokenForToken()` - now includes resource parameter when refreshing tokens

The fix ensures that when `_resourceMetadata?.resource` is available, it is consistently included in all OAuth2 requests throughout the authentication flow.

## Test Plan

- [x] Verified the fix addresses the specific code location mentioned in #261364 (line 599 in extHostAuthentication.ts)
- [x] Ensured the resource parameter is added in both token exchange scenarios
- [x] Confirmed the implementation follows the same pattern as the existing authorization request code

261717,closed,Ability to pass down WWW-Authenticate challenges down to Auth Providers,TylerLeonhardt,"Fixes https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/260156

Here's what a WWW-Authenticate header looks like from the very real Azure situation:

```
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
    realm="""",
    authorization_uri=""https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize"",
    error=""insufficient_claims"",
    claims=""eyJhY2Nlc3NfdG9rZW4iOnsiYWNycyI6eyJlc3NlbnRpYWwiOnRydWUsInZhbHVlcyI6WyJwMSJdfX19""
```
> Note: put on newlines for readibility

This generically looks like this:
```
WWW-Authenticate: <challenge>
// or
WWW-Authenticate: <challenge1>,..., <challengeN>
```

A challenge looks like this:
```
challenge = <auth-scheme> <auth-param>, …, <auth-paramN>
```
Where:
* `auth-scheme` is a case-insensitive string
* `auth-param` is `key=value` where `key` and `value` are strings (key is unique within the challenge) 

which in TypeScript becomes:
```ts
interface AuthenticationChallenge {
  scheme: string
  params: Record<string, string>
}
```

Regardless of all of that, the API for ""extension that wants auth"" is as simple as possible... and all about simply passing the WWW-Authenticate value into the Auth API so the extension doesn't have to be in the business of parsing this complex string:


```ts
AuthenticationSessionRequest {
  scopes?: string[];
  challenge: string;
}

declare module 'vscode' {
  export namespace authentication {
    export function getSession(providerId: string, scopeListOrRequest: ReadonlyArray<string> | AuthenticationSessionRequest, options?: AuthenticationGetSessionOptions): Thenable<AuthenticationSession | undefined>;
  }
}
```
In other words:
```
vscode.authentication.getSession(
  'microsoft',
  {
    scopes: // can be supplied otherwise will be inferred from the challenge
    challenge: // literal string from WWW-Authenticate header in the request that failed
  }
  options); // same options
```

This shape let's us support:
* An AuthenticationSession needs to be re-created (like if there are `claims` in the challenge (aka metadata inside of the token that arent scopes)
* A completely new session needs to be created because more scopes are required. (ex: MCP will use this when you use a tool that needs more permissions than what the token can do

The challenge becomes the star, and since the auth extension is stateless, it will need to know the scopes so the option to provide them is there if needed.

### extension supplying auth perspective

From the ""extension supplying auth perspective"" we are starting with this API but it doesn't need to be finalized at the same time as the above:

AuthProvider implements two new functions:
```ts
export interface AuthenticationProviderOptions {
  supportsChallenges?: boolean;
}

interface AuthenticationChallenge {
  scheme: string
  params: Record<string, string>
}
interface AuthenticationConstraint {
  readonly challenges: readonly AuthenticationChallenge[];
  readonly scopes?: readonly string[];
}

interface AuthenticationProvider {
  getSessionsFromChallenges?(constraint: AuthenticationConstraint, options: AuthenticationProviderSessionOptions): Thenable<AuthenticationSession[]>;
  createSessionFromChallenges?(constraint: AuthenticationConstraint, options: AuthenticationProviderSessionOptions): Thenable<AuthenticationSession>;
}
```

This lets the Auth Provider Opt-in to supporting challenges.",2025-08-14 22:21:35+00:00,2025-08-15T01:10:07Z,2025-08-15T01:10:06Z,True,1,0,12,704,121,22,1,2025-08-15 01:10:06+00:00,71,3311,False,True,False,False,False,False,22,1,23,2665,1624,1041,2,11,1.0,1.0,2025-08-15T00:38:02Z,vscode

Addresses issue #260762. This adds the `workbench.action.compareEditor.openSide` or `DIFF_OPEN_SIDE` constant in to the `MenuRegistry`, which registers it into the Command Palette.

Below is a screenshot showing it in the command palette.

## How to Test
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Open a folder with two files.
3. Select one file for compare in the Explorer pane by right-clicking it and click `Select for Compare` in the context menu.
4. Select another file by right-clicking it and clicking on `Compare with Selected` in the context menu.
5. The diff viewer should now open. Click on one of the file editors. This can be either side.
6. Open the Command Palette by hitting CTRL + SHIFT + P (Command/Cmd for Mac, instead of CTRL).
7. Look for ""Open File on Selected Side"". Click it while the desired file editor on either side is selected.
8. The desired file should be opened on its own.

261381,open,Add mouse drag scrolling to scrollable element and hover widget,LeftPhalange,"Adds functionality based on issue #239704.

This PR adds `AbstractScrollableElement` functionality to include mouse drag scrolling in the hover widget. By default, `handleDragScroll` is disabled and will not be triggered in the main editor view. This is selectively enabled within the `ui/hover/hoverWidget` component.

## Demonstration

![Recording 2025-08-12 215730](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/110aad6b-c58d-4bd5-8d8c-71e248239e09)

## How to test
In Visual Studio Code, hover over some text that has a definition, or anything that triggers the `HoverWidget`. Press and hold the left mouse button anywhere in the text inside the hover info widget, and move the mouse up to the top, or the bottom of it. You can also scroll from left to right.",2025-08-13 02:04:42+00:00,2025-08-18T08:37:27Z,,False,1,0,3,82,1,4,1,,63,760,False,False,False,False,False,False,4,1,38,4343,3317,1026,1,3,1.0,1.0,2025-08-13T02:05:37Z,vscode

Historically the about dialogs created their details themselves meaning they could only display details available in their layer. Now, about takes the detail information and we can calculate desktop details for both custom(html) and native dialogs.

This is a minimal defensive fix for #260880 where we just disable the message about no shell integration.

This is another hard to reproduce and verify problem and the actual suspected fix is much riskier in a pretty critical part of code that runs before every new chat terminal is created: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/261202.

**Issue**

[Listener to identify Human VS AI changes #259077](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/259077)

**Description**
This is a comprehensive system for checking differences between human and AI edits. It is formatted as follows:

#### __1. Core Classes and Enums__

- __`LineEditSource` enum__ (`src/vs/editor/common/lineEditSource.ts`):

  - `Undetermined = 0` - Unknown or untracked edit source
  - `Human = 1` - Last edited by human user
  - `AI = 2` - Last edited by AI/automated tools

- __`LineEditTracker` class__ (`src/vs/editor/common/model/lineEditTracker.ts`):

  - Tracks edit sources for each line in a text model
  - Memory-efficient (only stores non-undetermined lines)
  - Handles complex editing operations (insertions, deletions, line merges)
  - Event-driven with `onDidChangeLineEditSources` event

- __`TextModelEditSource` class__ (`src/vs/editor/common/textModelEditSource.ts`):

  - Comprehensive edit source classification system
  - Supports metadata for detailed edit tracking
  - AI extension detection with known extension patterns

#### __2. Features__

1. __Edit Source Classification__:

   - Human operations: typing, pasting, cutting, command execution
   - AI operations: inline completions, chat edits, known AI extensions
   - Separate AI extension detection (Cline, Copilot, Continue, etc.) (this is for non standard input, like that done by Cline)

2. __Edit Handling__:

   - Line insertions with proper line number shifting
   - Partial and full line deletions
   - Line merging operations
   - Multi-line replacements
   - Edit source priority resolution (Human > AI > Undetermined)

3. __Memory Optimization__:

   - Only stores determined line sources
   - Automatic cleanup of deleted lines
   - line number shifting algorithms

4. __Persistence Support__:

   - Serialization/deserialization for state persistence
   - Validation for serialized data
   - Graceful handling of invalid data

#### __3. API Integration__

- __Main Thread API__ (`src/vs/workbench/api/browser/mainThreadBulkEdits.ts`):

  - `MainThreadLineEditTracker` for accessing line edit sources
  - Extension context integration for accurate AI detection
  - Bulk edit operations with proper source attribution

- __Extension Host Protocol__ (`src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHost.protocol.ts`):

  - `ILineEditSourcesChangeData` interface for change events
  - Protocol definitions for main/extension host communication

### __Using the API__

#### __1. Basic Line Edit Source Querying__

```typescript
// Get edit source for a specific line
const editSource = textModel.getLineEditSource(lineNumber);
// Returns: LineEditSource.Human, LineEditSource.AI, or LineEditSource.Undetermined

// Get all tracked line edit sources
const allSources = textModel.getAllLineEditSources();
// Returns: Map<number, LineEditSource>
```

#### __2. Listening to Changes__

```typescript
// Listen for line edit source changes
const disposable = textModel.onDidChangeLineEditSources((event) => {
  event.changes.forEach((source, lineNumber) => {
    console.log(`Line ${lineNumber} edit source changed to ${source}`);
  });
});

// always Dispose
disposable.dispose();
```

#### __3. Making Edits with Proper Source Attribution__

```typescript
// Human edit
textModel.pushEditOperations(null, edits, null, undefined, 
  EditSources.cursor({ kind: 'type' }));

// AI edit from inline completion
textModel.pushEditOperations(null, edits, null, undefined, 
  EditSources.inlineCompletionAccept({
    nes: false,
    requestUuid: 'unique-id',
    languageId: 'typescript',
    providerId: undefined
  }));

// Extension-based AI edit
textModel.pushEditOperations(null, edits, null, undefined, 
  EditSources.extensionApplyEdits({
    extensionId: 'cline.cline',
    extensionName: 'Cline',
    isAiTool: true
  }));
```

#### __4. API Usage__

```typescript
// Clear all line edit sources
textModel.getLineEditTracker().clear();

// Serialize for persistence
const serializedData = textModel.getLineEditTracker().serialize();

// Restore from serialized data
textModel.getLineEditTracker().deserialize(serializedData);

// Direct tracker access
const tracker = textModel.getLineEditTracker();
tracker.handleContentChanges(changes, editSources);
```

### __Line Edit Visual Indicator__
__1. Enable/Disable Commands:__

```typescript
// Commands available in Command Palette:
- ""Enable Line Edit Indicators"" (editor.action.lineEditIndicator.enable)
- ""Disable Line Edit Indicators"" (editor.action.lineEditIndicator.disable)  
- ""Toggle Line Edit Indicators"" (editor.action.lineEditIndicator.toggle)
```

__2. Programmatic Control:__

```typescript
// Get the contribution
const contribution = LineEditIndicatorContribution.get(editor);

// Enable indicators
contribution.enable();

// Disable indicators  
contribution.disable();

// Toggle indicators
contribution.toggle();

// Check if enabled
const isEnabled = contribution.isEnabled();
```

__3. Default Behavior:__

- __Disabled by default__ - must be explicitly enabled
- __Real-time updates__ - indicators update immediately as edits are made
- __Undetermined lines__ - no indicator

### __API Usage Examples__

#### __1. Basic Line Edit Tracking__

```typescript
// Query line edit sources
const editSource = textModel.getLineEditSource(5); // LineEditSource.Human | AI | Undetermined
const allSources = textModel.getAllLineEditSources(); // Map<number, LineEditSource>

// Listen for changes
const disposable = textModel.onDidChangeLineEditSources((event) => {
  event.changes.forEach((source, lineNumber) => {
    console.log(`Line ${lineNumber} changed to ${source}`);
  });
});
```

#### __2. Making Tracked Edits__

```typescript
// Human edit
textModel.pushEditOperations(null, edits, null, undefined, 
  EditSources.cursor({ kind: 'type' }));

// AI edit  
textModel.pushEditOperations(null, edits, null, undefined, 
  EditSources.inlineCompletionAccept({
    nes: false,
    requestUuid: 'uuid',
    languageId: 'typescript',
    providerId: undefined
  }));

// Extension AI edit
textModel.pushEditOperations(null, edits, null, undefined, 
  EditSources.extensionApplyEdits({
    extensionId: 'cline.cline',
    extensionName: 'Cline',
    isAiTool: true
  }));
```

#### __3. Visual Indicator Management__

```typescript
// Enable visual indicators
const contribution = LineEditIndicatorContribution.get(editor);
contribution.enable();

// The indicators will automatically:
// - Show red triangles for human-edited lines
// - Show blue triangles for AI-edited lines  
// - Update in real-time as edits are made
// - Display tooltips on hover
```

260957,closed,win: self-heal missing 'Open with Code' context menu entries after background update,yensubldg,"Adds self-heal logic in build/win32/code.iss to restore missing “Open with Code” context menu registry entries when they disappear after a silent/background update.

**Summary**
- Runs in CurStepChanged at ssPostInstall.
- Recreates file, directory, background, drive verbs if tasks previously selected (or keys existed) and they’re now missing.
- Skips Windows 11 Insiders AppX scenario (existing conditional preserved).
- Logs healing actions; wrapped in try/except to avoid installer failure.

**Rationale**
Users reported losing context menu entries post update; manual PowerShell restore works. This mitigates by automatically re-creating keys.

**Test Plan**
1. Install with context menu tasks selected.
2. Delete keys:
   HKCR\*\shell\VSCode
   HKCR\Directory\shell\VSCode
   HKCR\Directory\Background\shell\VSCode
3. Run updated installer with /VERYSILENT /UPDATE=1.
4. Verify keys restored and installer log contains “Healing VS Code ...”.
5. Confirm no effect if keys present (idempotent) or tasks never chosen.

**Risk**
Low: only writes when keys missing; avoids Insiders AppX path; catches exceptions.

**Follow-ups**
Possible telemetry or unify with modern Windows 11 integration later.",2025-08-11 07:02:29+00:00,2025-09-25T23:25:42Z,,False,2,0,3,52,0,1,2,2025-08-11 07:27:14+00:00,84,1200,False,False,False,False,False,False,1,2,134,2087,1497,590,1,2,2.0,2.0,2025-08-11T07:06:37Z,vscode

260848,closed,build/npm: add explicit npm version validation in preinstall.js (mirrors Node.js check),ali90h,"# Summary

This PR addresses issue [[#252372] by adding explicit npm version validation to the existing `build/npm/preinstall.js` script, following the maintainer preference outlined in the issue discussion.

## Changes Made

- **This PR modifies only** `build/npm/preinstall.js`.
- **Extended existing Node.js validation logic** in `build/npm/preinstall.js` to include npm version checking
- **Added `VSCODE_SKIP_NPM_VERSION_CHECK` environment variable** for consistency with existing `VSCODE_SKIP_NODE_VERSION_CHECK`
- **Set minimum npm version requirement to v10.8.0** *(chosen to align with the current Node requirement; happy to adjust if the team prefers)*
- **Maintained identical error messaging patterns** using ANSI colors and consistent formatting
- **Added robust error handling** for npm unavailability and version parsing failures
- **Preserved all existing functionality** while seamlessly integrating npm validation


## Implementation Details

### Approach Rationale
- **Centralized validation**: Keeps all version enforcement in single `preinstall.js` file as preferred by maintainers
- **No `engines` field**: Avoids adding `engines` to `package.json` to prevent maintenance overhead from multiple sources of truth
- **Consistent patterns**: Reuses exact same regex parsing, comparison logic, and error styling as existing Node validation

### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// Uses same regex-based parsing as Node validation
const npmVersion = /^(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)/.exec(npmVersionOutput.trim());

// Maintains identical comparison logic
if (majorNpmVersion < 10 || (majorNpmVersion === 10 && minorNpmVersion < 8)) {
    console.error('\x1b[1;31m*** Please use npm v10.8.0 or later for development.\x1b[0;0m');
    throw new Error();
}
```

### Error Messages
- **Availability check**: ""npm is not available. Please ensure npm is installed and available in PATH.""
- **Version requirement**: ""Please use npm v10.8.0 or later for development.""
- **Upgrade guidance**: ""Run 'npm install -g npm@latest' to update npm to the latest version.""

## Testing

- [x] Verified with npm 10.8.0+ (passes validation)
- [x] Verified with npm < 10.8.0 (fails with appropriate error)
- [x] Verified with npm unavailable (fails with clear error message)
- [x] Confirmed `VSCODE_SKIP_NPM_VERSION_CHECK=true` bypasses validation
- [x] Ensured all existing functionality remains unchanged
- [x] Validated error message formatting matches existing Node validation

## Verification (manual)
### Fail (old npm):
```bash
REAL_NPM=""$(command -v npm)""
mkdir -p /tmp/npmshim
cat > /tmp/npmshim/npm <<SH
#!/usr/bin/env bash
if [[ ""$1"" == ""--version"" ]]; then
  echo 10.7.9
  exit 0
fi
exec ""$REAL_NPM"" ""$@""
SH
chmod +x /tmp/npmshim/npm

PATH=""/tmp/npmshim:$PATH"" npm install
# Expect: ""*** Please use npm v10.8.0 or later for development."" and exit
```
### Pass (compatible npm):
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/npmshim
npm install
# Expect: install proceeds (no preinstall error)
```
### Skip (env override):
```bash
# If needed, recreate the shim from the Fail step (10.7.9)
PATH=""/tmp/npmshim:$PATH"" \
VSCODE_SKIP_NPM_VERSION_CHECK=1 \
npm install
# Expect: install proceeds (npm gate skipped)
```




**Maintainer Preference Honored:**
- ✅ Extends existing `preinstall.js` validation (as requested by @deepak1556)
- ✅ Avoids `engines` field in `package.json` (as explicitly rejected by maintainers)
- ✅ Maintains single source of enforcement
- ✅ Minimizes maintenance burden

## Related

- Closes #252372
- Alternative to PRs #255060 and #260368 (which add `engines` field)

This adds `ChatCustomConfirmationWidget2` that aims to be this new style for all tools.

I did not test the following:

- `InstallExtensionsTool`/`ExtensionsInstallConfirmationWidgetSubPart` as it's not hooked up. Adoption for others didn't have any problems though.
- `kind: 'confirmation` types as defined in [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b4b07a0f221229f1ba58dc491a6e5ab965027445/src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/common/chatService.ts#L250-L257), not sure where they show up

260583,closed,"Suggest widget: Bug fix - when widget is too tall, ensure larger of above and below space is used.",andr8928,"**Issue addressed:**

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/152324

**Description:**
Currently, when the suggest widget has enough space below, everything is fine:
<img width=""742"" height=""563"" alt=""monaco-test-suggest-OK"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31f3cecc-dd88-4d39-8561-c96606db48eb"" />

    

When the suggest widget is larger than the area below the current line, the current code always calculates the height and position of the widget using the space **above** the line (even if the space below is larger):

<img width=""985"" height=""255"" alt=""1"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/593bda3b-a4b4-484a-bdb9-67ba9fa21d35"" />




With this change, if the suggest box is larger than the space below, it will now choose the largest of ""above"" and ""below"" to use in its calculations (unless force-above is enabled):

<img width=""926"" height=""265"" alt=""2"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14ce7bf2-d678-4d00-8290-93201d7c7907"" />

Added a default localize('agentEditsLabel', 'Agent Edits') fallback to guarantee a string type.
Updated localize calls in the confirmation message to ensure placeholders ({0}, {1}) match arguments.
Prevents red-highlight warnings in the editor and ensures correct label display for both single and multiple file scenarios.

260446,closed,Fix OAuth redirect URI format to align with Microsoft's URL standards,bluedog13,"## OAuth Redirect URI Format Not Aligned with Microsoft's URL Standards

### Problem
VS Code's OAuth implementation generates redirect URIs without trailing slashes, while Microsoft's own OAuth 2.0 documentation and standards-compliant identity providers (including Entra ID) require trailing slashes in redirect URIs per RFC specifications.

This creates a mismatch where:
- **VS Code generates**: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- **IDP expects**: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`

### Root Cause
Microsoft Entra ID (and other compliant IDPs) automatically append trailing slashes to redirect URIs during OAuth flows, following Microsoft's documented standards. However, VS Code's implementation returns URLs without trailing slashes, causing URI mismatch validation failures.

### Recent Change Context
A June 29th PR that modified `loopbackServer.ts` removed the trailing slash, introducing this standards compliance issue. This change made VS Code generate non-compliant redirect URIs that don't align with Microsoft's own OAuth 2.0 format requirements.

### Solution
This PR restores trailing slashes in two key locations:

1. **`loopbackServer.ts`** (line 105): Runtime redirect URI generation
2. **`oauth.ts`** (lines 739-746): Dynamic client registration redirect URIs

**Changes:**
- `http://127.0.0.1:${port}` → `http://127.0.0.1:${port}/`
- `http://localhost` → `http://localhost/`
- `http://127.0.0.1` → `http://127.0.0.1/`
- `http://localhost:${port}` → `http://localhost:${port}/`

### Impact
- Resolves OAuth authentication failures with ""redirect_uri_mismatch"" errors
- Ensures compatibility with standards-compliant OAuth providers
- Aligns VS Code with Microsoft's documented OAuth 2.0 URL format requirements

### Standards Reference
This change ensures VS Code follows Microsoft's own OAuth 2.0 redirect URI format requirements, improving compatibility with standards-compliant identity providers.

260368,open,feat: add engines property to root package.json,rinilkunhiraman,"## Description

This PR adds the `engines` property to the root `package.json` to specify the required Node.js and npm versions for VS Code development, addressing issue #252372.

## Changes

- Added `engines` property with Node.js version `>=22.17.0` (matching the `.nvmrc` file)
- Added npm version `>=10.8.0` (compatible with the required Node.js version)
- This provides clear version requirements for contributors
- Helps prevent installation issues with unsupported Node.js/npm versions

## Why this change is needed

As mentioned in the original issue, the [How to Contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) guide mentions using `npm install` but doesn't specify which npm or Node.js versions are required. This change:

1. **Provides quick reference** for required versions
2. **Prevents errors** when using unsupported versions  
3. **Matches existing `.nvmrc`** specification (22.17.0)
4. **Follows npm standards** for version specification

## Testing

- [x] Verified the `engines` field is valid JSON
- [x] Confirmed Node.js version matches `.nvmrc` 
- [x] Verified npm version is compatible with Node.js 22.17.0
- [x] No breaking changes - this is purely additive metadata

260365,open,fix(sourcemap): normalize paths to avoid duplicated prefixes like fil…,hihry,"fixes : #251233
### Problem

When building with esbuild and gulp-sourcemaps, the generated `.map` files often include:

- `file:///` prefixes in `sources`
- Full absolute paths like `/home/user/vscode/src/vs/...`

These break debugging tools and create duplicated or corrupted paths when loading source maps in the editor or browser.
### Solution

This PR fixes the sourcemap path normalization by:

- Removing `file:///` prefixes from `sourceMap.sources`
- Replacing long absolute `/src/...` paths with the expected `vs/...` format

### Problem
On GitHub.dev, the SCM status bar entries showed internal identifiers like `status.scm.0` instead of readable labels.

### Solution
Ensured the `name` field of each `IStatusbarEntry` is properly set to a readable string like `Source Control: Sync` or `Source Control: SwitchToBranch`, falling back to the command title if no repo-agnostic name is found.

This ensures GitHub.dev's status bar menu does not fall back to internal IDs as visible labels.

260232,open,feat(scm): Customizable SCM Graph History Item Formatting (GitLens-style Variable Support),Zahariel1942,"### Overview

This PR implements customizable formatting for SCM Graph History items in VS Code #255719, allowing users to personalize how commit history is displayed in the Source Control Graph view. Inspired by GitLens, it introduces a configuration option for variable-based formatting, enabling greater flexibility and clarity for teams and individuals.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Configuration Setting

Added `""scm.graph.historyItemFormat""` to `src/vs/workbench/contrib/scm/browser/scm.contribution.ts`:

- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** Controls the format of each history item in the Source Control Graph view. Supports variables:
  - `${author}` — Commit author name
  - `${authorEmail}` — Author email
  - `${subject}` — Commit subject/title
  - `${message}` — Full commit message
  - `${hash}` — Full commit hash
  - `${displayId}` — Shortened commit hash
  - `${date}` — Relative date (e.g., ""2 hours ago"")
  - `${timestamp}` — Full timestamp

**Examples:**
- `${subject}`
- `${displayId} - ${subject}`
- `${author} • ${subject}`
- `[${displayId}] ${subject} by ${author}`
- `${subject} (${date})`

#### 2. Formatting Function

Introduced `formatHistoryItem` in `src/vs/workbench/contrib/scm/browser/util.ts`:

- Replaces variables in the format string with actual commit data.
- Handles missing values gracefully (empty string fallback).
- Preserves line breaks in commit messages.
- Removes trailing spaces for clean appearance.

#### 3. Renderer Integration

Updated `HistoryItemRenderer` in `src/vs/workbench/contrib/scm/browser/scmHistoryViewPane.ts`:

- Observes configuration changes for `""scm.graph.historyItemFormat""` using VS Code's observable pattern.
- Uses `autorun` for real-time UI updates when settings change.
- Applies custom formatting via `formatHistoryItem`.

#### 4. Comprehensive Testing

Added test coverage in `src/vs/workbench/contrib/scm/test/browser/util.test.ts`:

- Tests all supported variables.
- Validates default and multi-variable formats.

This is in support of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/257679.

This will also support https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/259901 if, for example, we move to using `npm` for the ""does the package exist"" check and npm is not available.

I am working in using the server.json contained in NuGet packages to improve MCP installation. To do these, I need to invoke `dotnet tool install` commands to download the package. If the user does not have `dotnet` installed, we should let them known. This is prior to the MCP server being installed so the existing notification flow will not kick in yet.

The URL and label are optionally sent back as part of the error. I believe this is a useful additional to the contract of `github.copilot.chat.mcp.setup.validatePackage`.

It looks like this:

Also, added `dotnet` to the list of recognized missing commands in case `dotnet tool exec` is used.

259947,closed,💄 Todo list widget: Muted design and progress scrolling,digitarald,"## Summary

Enhances the chat todo list widget with comprehensive UX improvements including progress indicators, smart scrolling, and refined styling.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c10b7dcc-8baa-4625-9bfa-8263566c3cc4


## Changes

### Core Features
- **Progress Indicator**: Changes ""Tasks"" → ""Todos"" with dynamic progress display (e.g., ""Todos (2/5)"")
- **Smart Scrolling**: Auto-scrolls to relevant items with workflow-aware positioning
- **Refined Styling**: Less prominent header with compact, muted appearance

### Technical Improvements
- **TypeScript**: Added `getProgressText()` method and `scrollToRelevantItem()` with intelligent positioning logic
- **CSS**: Responsive sizing using `calc(6.5 * 24px)`, scroll snap behavior, and modern scrollbar styling
- **UX**: Shows 6.5 items with half-line affordance, prioritizes in-progress items, handles edge cases

### Behavior
- **Empty state**: Shows ""Todos"" 
- **With progress**: Shows ""Todos (X/Y)"" format
- **Scrolling**: Centers active items, shows completed context, scrolls to top when all items are not-started
- **Responsive**: Uses VS Code's standard calc() patterns for maintainable sizing

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Follows VS Code localization patterns
- ✅ Maintains existing widget functionality
- ✅ CSS follows VS Code design system",2025-08-06 01:53:42+00:00,2025-09-20T23:25:13Z,2025-08-06T04:26:11Z,True,0,0,2,106,10,2,0,2025-08-06 04:26:11+00:00,55,1343,False,False,True,False,True,False,2,0,0,508,302,206,1,2,,,,vscode

Changes the editor pane order for comparing active file to clipboard, so that the clipboard is on the right (modified) instead of left (original) side.

This is to reflect the behavior of all the other `Compare...` commands where the active file is on the left.

This is the simplest fix for issue https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/259434 if it is to be considered a bug, which is indicated by the behavior of the other similar commands.

Firefox doesn't allow to watch style element content using a MutationObserver. A MutationObserver is used to synchronize main windows styles with external windows. As a consequence, the theme is not properly updated on external windows on Firefox.

As a workaround, also add a data-hash attribute on the style elements, and watch it as well in the MutationObserver

# 🌌 Revolutionary Feature: ILN Language Unification for VS Code

## Problem Solved
Modern development requires mastering numerous languages for different paradigms (Go for concurrency, Rust for safety, Python for AI, etc.), creating significant friction.

## Solution: ILN (Informatique Language Nexus)
This PR introduces a VS Code extension for ILN, a revolutionary system that unifies programming paradigms through ""essences."" It allows developers to use concepts from any language within a single, consistent syntax.

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Auto-completion** for ILN essences (`chan!`, `own!`, `ml!`, etc.).
- **Hover Documentation** explaining each paradigm.
- **Multi-language Support** (Python, JS, TS, Go, Rust, and more).

### Revolutionary Impact
- **Reduces learning curve** by unifying paradigms.
- **Increases development speed** by eliminating context switching.
- **Introduces the ILN philosophy** to over 200M VS Code users.

This contribution is fully functional and has passed all compilation tests.

**Project Context:**
- **Official ILN Repository:** [https://github.com/Tryboy869/iln-nexus](https://github.com/Tryboy869/iln-nexus)
- **Author:** Tryboy869

The future of programming is unified. The future is ILN.

259762,open,Fix notebook code actions on save not triggering for LSP servers,MarthinusBosman,"Fixes #216653 and astral-sh/ruff-vscode#51 where code actions (like source.organizeImports and source.fixAll) from LSP servers like Ruff were not being triggered when saving notebook files.

The problem was that notebook save participants were using CodeActionTriggerType.Invoke for all code actions, but many LSP servers filter their actions based on trigger type.

This change uses different trigger types based on the code action kind:
- CodeActionTriggerType.Invoke for notebook-specific actions (notebook.*) to preserve cross-cell editing capabilities (addresses #183855)
- CodeActionTriggerType.Auto for regular LSP actions (source.*) to match standard save participant behavior

Resolves issues with extensions like Ruff not organizing imports or applying fixes on notebook save when configured in notebook.codeActionsOnSave.

This works around the lack of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/259100 and is progress on https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/257679. There will be a separate PR on the chat extension to support server.json in NuGet packages.

It enhances the `github.copilot.chat.mcp.setup.flow` command to have an additional `type` property. When this type property is set to `""server.json""`, the result is treated as an MCP Registry server.json and mapped to the VS Code configuration format. If the `type` property is falsey set or set to `""vscode""`, the existing codepath is used.

Additionally, I updated the `toScannedMcpServerAndInputs` to be a public static method so it can be called after the `github.copilot.chat.mcp.setup.flow` command returns. 

I noticed the resulting `args` and `env` placeholder values had the format `{input:foo}`, instead of format `${input:foo}`. Based on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/reference/variables-reference#_input-variables, it seems like this was a bug in the original implementation, but I may be wrong. @sandy081 - could you confirm?

Verified with:
- npm: `@azure/mcp` (old flow, no server.json)
- Python: `mcp-server-fetch` (old flow, no server.json)
- Docker: `mcp/node-code-sandbox` (old flow, no server.json)
- NuGet: `NuGet.Mcp.Server` (new flow), `Knacode.SampleMcpServer` (new flow, this one has an input)

Rationale
The existing hover text did not follow the UI capitalization conventions used in the project. This change improves consistency and adheres to the design and style guidelines.

This PR fixes the placement issue with the terminal icon picker widget, as discussed in #211083.

✅ **Changes made:**
- Updated `TerminalIconPicker` so it now accepts a `source` parameter (`'commandPalette'` or `'terminalTab'`).
- The picker is now dynamically positioned:
  - **When triggered via the command palette**: appears centered below the command center.
  - **When triggered via the terminal tab**: appears near the terminal tab area.
- Adjusted `TerminalInstance.changeIcon` to call the picker with the correct source.

📌 **Why:**
Previously, the icon picker always appeared near the top center, which could look odd or be partially hidden.
This makes the UX more intuitive by placing the picker close to where it was triggered.

✅ **How to test:**
- Trigger the terminal icon picker via the terminal tab ➜ it should appear near the tab area.
- Trigger via the command palette ➜ it should appear centered below the command center.

---

This is likely due to Windows Defender, but adding node to exclusions didn't seem to help. Because of this, plus we shouldn't be launching processes so often, the caching now must be explicitly cleared in order to get the latest. This is just a limitation we'll have to include in the documentation (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues/8700).

Fixes #256854
This PR refactors code to replace all usages of `AsyncIterableObject` with `AsyncIterableProducer` to align with the updated async iteration API in VS Code.

### Changes
- Updated method signatures and return types to use `AsyncIterableProducer`.
- Migrated relevant `AsyncIterableObject` instantiations to `AsyncIterableProducer`.
- Adjusted import statements accordingly.
- Verified that behavior remains consistent after migration.

### Rationale
`AsyncIterableProducer` is now the preferred class for async iteration in VS Code. This migration helps improve memory efficiency and reduces the risk of potential memory leaks in async iteration scenarios.

259089,closed,Important fix for resource validation in MCP,TylerLeonhardt,"In this example:

MCP url: https://foo.com/mcp
WWW-Auth resource_metadata: https://foo.com/laugh/in/the/face/of/conventions.json
PRM: https://foo.com/laugh/in/the/face/of/conventions.json
PRM resource property: https://foo.com/mcp

I use to do:
a URL derived from ""WWW-Auth resource_metadata"" (which is actually just PRM) is compared to ""PRM resource property""

but instead it should be:

""MCP url"" compared to ""PRM resource property""

Which is what this PR addresses

It can take longer in a remote window for the tasks service to update after a config change, such as when a task is added to the `tasks.json`. Before, we had a static timeout of 200 ms. Now, we poll for up to 5 seconds to wait for the task to be discovered. 

The key for tasks in a remote window is different from the local case, so we have to parse the URI to check for the workspace folder

258844,closed,fix: preserve OAuth subpaths in endpoint construction per RFC 8414,arjunkmrm,"Dev from https://smithery.ai here 👋! We noticed a bug when testing our server's OAuth flow where subpaths were being dropped when creating OAuth endpoints. This PR fixes `getDefaultMetadataForUrl` to preserve them per rfc 8414 section 3: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-3

Authorization servers supporting metadata MUST make a JSON document containing metadata as specified in Section 2 available at a path formed by inserting a well-known URI string into the authorization server's issuer identifier between the host component and the path component, if any. By default, the well-known URI string used is ""/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server"". This path MUST use the ""https"" scheme. The syntax and semantics of "".well-known"" are defined in RFC 5785 [RFC5785]. The well-known URI suffix used MUST be registered in the IANA ""Well-Known URIs"" registry [IANA.well-known].

## Issue

See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/258845

OAuth servers hosted at subpaths (e.g., `https://api.example.com/oauth/server`) were having their paths dropped:

```typescript
// Before (broken)
Input: https://api.example.com/oauth/server
Output: https://api.example.com/authorize 

// After (fixed)  
Input: https://api.example.com/oauth/server
Output: https://api.example.com/oauth/server/authorize 
```

## Changes

- Preserve existing paths in `getDefaultMetadataForUrl`
- Add RFC 8414 reference

Fixes the same issue as [modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#687](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/pull/687).

258496,open,fix(workspace.openTextDocument): handle fragments for selection in URIs,janhartman,"TL;DR - because `vscode.workspace.openTextDocument()` does not handle fragments in URIs, we can wrongly open files as external and break search.

## VSCode build details
```
Version: 1.102.2
Commit: c306e94f98122556ca081f527b466015e1bc37b0
Date: 2025-07-22T12:15:48.520Z
Electron: 35.6.0
ElectronBuildId: 11847422
Chromium: 134.0.6998.205
Node.js: 22.15.1
V8: 13.4.114.21-electron.0
OS: Darwin arm64 24.5.0
```

## Reproduction
1. Open a folder in VSCode. The folder should contain a text file.
2. Call [`vscode.workspace.openTextDocument()`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#workspace) with a URI containing a link fragment . The URI should point to the text file in the opened folder.
3. The file is opened as external despite being in the directory. Furthermore, if your fragment is a line selection like `#L4`, the cursor will not move to the target line.
4. If you pass the URI without the link fragment, it will open as expected.

Video demonstration: https://www.loom.com/share/e30501c3c3414efd81464024fc83decd?sid=945e0362-a38d-4848-b4aa-00847fd63e10

### Extension
It's easiest to reproduce this with a minimal extension:
`package.json`:
```json
{
  ""name"": ""simple-webview-extension"",
  ""version"": ""0.0.1"",
  ""engines"": {
    ""vscode"": ""^1.60.0""
  },
  ""main"": ""./extension.js"",
  ""contributes"": {
    ""views"": {
      ""explorer"": [
        {
          ""id"": ""simpleWebview"",
          ""name"": ""File Opener"",
          ""type"": ""webview""
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


`extension.js`:
```javascript
const vscode = require('vscode');
const os = require('os');

class SimpleWebviewProvider {
    resolveWebviewView(webviewView) {
        webviewView.webview.options = { enableScripts: true };
        webviewView.webview.html = `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <button onclick=""openFile()"">Open foo.txt</button>
    <button onclick=""openFileWithLine()"">Open foo.txt at line 4</button>
    
    <script>
        const vscode = acquireVsCodeApi();

        function openFile() {
            vscode.postMessage({ type: 'openFile' });
        }

        function openFileWithLine() {
            vscode.postMessage({ type: 'openFileWithLine' });
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>`;

        webviewView.webview.onDidReceiveMessage(async data => {
            try {
                let link = `${os.homedir()}/.tmp/debug/foo.txt`
                if (data.type === 'openFileWithLine') {
                    link += '#L4'
                }
                
                const uri = vscode.Uri.parse(link)
                const document = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uri)
                await vscode.window.showTextDocument(document)
            } catch (error) {
                console.log('Error', error)
            }
        });
    }
}

function activate(context) {
    context.subscriptions.push(
        vscode.window.registerWebviewViewProvider('simpleWebview', new SimpleWebviewProvider())
    );
}

module.exports = { activate };
```

Directory preparation:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.tmp/debug
echo ""a\nb\nc\nd\ne"" > ~/.tmp/debug/foo.txt
```

Launch the extension, open the sidebar and click on the buttons. 
`Open foo.txt` should work as expected, `Open foo.txt at line 4` should open the file as external and not move the cursor to the specified line.

## Additional issue
I also noticed that if you open a file with a link fragment (so that it shows as external), then do a directory-wide search for a term present in the file, search will hang and dev tools will contain an error (see below). If you repeat the search, you'll see an error message under the search box.

I haven't been able to understand all the code yet
so soft wrapping seems to only work for 40% of `\n` when changing the editor size
cc @alexdima @rfon6ngy 

* #258022
* fixed wrapping going haywire when changing editor size
* added the `\n` softwrap check to `createLineBreaksFromPreviousLineBreaks()`, which handles word wrap while the editor is changing size (#258022)
* fixed wrapping in large files
  test https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/extensions/typescript-basics/syntaxes/TypeScript.tmLanguage.json (minify json first)
* Fixed wrapping sometimes not working correctly with `""editor.wordWrap"": ""bounded""/""wordWrapColumn""` (extending well past the 80char limit)
* extracted out the `lineText.includes('""')` check, so we don't have to recompute it on every single `\n`
